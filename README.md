# Multimedia Explorer

This is a simple Multimedia Explorer written in olden times, fixed a bit and put on GitHub.
This repo contains (almost) working fork for Lazarus.
See [sunchaserinfo/mediaexpl](https://github.com/sunchaserinfo/mediaexpl) for original Delphi 7 project.

## Backend

MediaExpl uses Winamp 2.9 plugins as a backend. You will need `out_wave.dll` and any 
`in_*.dll` plugins you want. You can find Winamp 2.9 at 
[oldversion.com](http://www.oldversion.com/windows/winamp/).

Put the plugins to the `Plugins` subdirectory at the directory with `MediaExpl.exe`.
